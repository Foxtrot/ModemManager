# Modem Manager
This is a module for the WiFi Pineapple intended to manage cellular modems.

## Feedback
If you have a modem, testing would be greatly appreciated! If you have any problems or want to give feedback, please use the
[forum thread](https://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/topic/38593-official-modem-manager/) over on the Hak5 Forums.

## Notes
After saving the configuration, you currently will need to reboot the pineapple to load the kernel module with the right VID/PID. Currently I am unable to remove and re-insert the module.

## To do
- Add CDC support
- Some info about the connection

## Installation
~~As the module isn't yet available, you need to install it manually. To do so:~~

~~1. Download the "master" branch of this module.~~
~~2. Create the folder `/pineapple/modules/ModemManager/` on the WiFi Pineapple.~~
~~3. Extract the downloaded `master.zip` into the `/pineapple/modules/ModemManager/` directory.~~
~~4. Refresh the WiFi Pineapple UI to find the module.~~

The module is now out on the manager.
